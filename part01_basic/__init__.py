The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly. 
Explicit is better than implicit. 明了优于隐晦；
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated. 复杂优于凌乱，
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. 特例亦不可违背原则
Although practicality beats purity. 即使实用比纯粹更优
Errors should never pass silently. 错误绝不能悄悄忽略
Unless explicitly silenced. 除非它明确需要如此
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. 面对不确定性，拒绝妄加猜测
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.任何问题应有一种，且最好只有一种，显而易见的解决方法
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch(除非你是荷兰人). 尽管这方法一开始并非如此直观
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
